This repository is for CSCI 310 - Java Fall 2016, Dr. MacEvoy.
Each assignment is in a different branch, and each branch has a seperate .java file for that assignment.
For example, Assignment 2 will be in the "assignment2" branch, in the file "Assignment2_description.java".
There is not, and should not be any content in the master branch.
